# Welcome!

#####  I am Isaac, a senior computer science major with a mathematics minor at the University of Maryland. I currently am working at [Raytheon Technologies](https://www.rtx.com/) as a software engineering intern. This repository is a collection of my work from various courses and passion projects. You can read more on the different sections below, enjoy!

## Linear Algebra

During the Spring 2021 semester I took MATH 401: Applications of linear algebra. During the course I completed weekly projects using iPython and Jupyter notebooks highlighting the different uses of linear algebra. Some cool topics include image compression, game theory, and least squared fitting.

## cpp

This folder contains a collection to some work I have done using `C++`. `C++` is my favorite programming language, so most of my passion projects are done using it.

## Capstone

At the University of Maryland, I am a [College Park Scholar](https://www.scholars.umd.edu/) in the [Science, Disovery, and the Universe](https://scholars-d8.umd.edu/programs/science-discovery-and-universe) program. At the end of this two year living-learning program, I completed a capstone project to earn my citation. A collection of the work that went into this project, as well as the final presentation poster, can be found in this folder. 

## Additional work

Some other projects I have been part off...

- A data science tutorial: [Click here](https://isaacbutz280.github.io/CMSC320_final/) for the tutorial itself, or [this link](https://github.com/isaacbutz280/CMSC320_final) leads to the repository if you wish to learn more about the background of the project.
- More to come soon...
