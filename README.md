My Personal Projects
===

Hello! My name is Isaac and I am a junior computer science student at the University of Maryland. My specialization is in data science, and a minor in Mathematics. I created this repo to showcase my work done during my time at university and beyond. It is a combination of projects I have completed for courses, as well as projects I have done in my own time. 

Please enjoy!
