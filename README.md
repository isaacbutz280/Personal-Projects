# Welcome!

#####  I am Isaac, a senior computer science major with a mathematics minor at the University of Maryland. I currently am working at [Raytheon Technologies](https://www.rtx.com/) as a software engineering intern. This repository is a collection of my work from various courses and passion projects. You can read more on the different sections below, enjoy!

## Linear Algebra

During the Spring 2021 semester I took MATH 401: Applications of linear algebra. During the course I completed weekly projects using iPython and Jupyter notebooks highlighting the different uses of linear algebra. Some cool topics include image compression, game theory, and least squared fitting.

## Rust

This folder contains work I have done using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Rust is by far my favorite language, and yes a large part of that is because of Ferris.

So far I have mostly done command line programs, but I am looking to branch out into GUI's soon!
 

## Capstone

At the University of Maryland, I am a [College Park Scholar](https://www.scholars.umd.edu/) in the [Science, Disovery, and the Universe](https://scholars-d8.umd.edu/programs/science-discovery-and-universe) program. At the end of this two year living-learning program, I completed a capstone project to earn my citation. A collection of the work that went into this project, as well as the final presentation poster, can be found in this folder. 

## Additional work

- A data science tutorial: [Click here](https://isaacbutz280.github.io/CMSC320_final/) for the tutorial itself, or [this link](https://github.com/isaacbutz280/CMSC320_final) leads to the repository if you wish to learn more about the background of the project.
